The CDK Rendering Library
===

A small library that helps in the rendering of molecules within the [Chemistry Development Kit][CDK]. This provides an abstraction layer between the objects that are to be rendered and that of the atoms and bonds themselves.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/sacko87/cdk.git
$ cd cdk
$ mvn test
```
